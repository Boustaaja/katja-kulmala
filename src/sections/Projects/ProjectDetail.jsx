    purpose:
      "This project was created as my personal project to strengthen and apply the skills I developed during my first year of studies, which focused heavily on C#. At the same time, I was also studying databases, so I wanted to combine both areas in a practical way. The theme was chosen based on my personal interests: I am learning Japanese and I am particularly interested in gamification and serious games, which made a language learning app a natural fit.",
    feature: [
      "Practice words in a game-like format",
      "Choose a category of words to study",
      "Request hints to support learning",
      "A life system is included: wrong answers reduce lives, adding challenge and motivation",
    ],
    technologies: [
      "C# and .NET (WPF framework)",
      "XAML for UI definition",
      "MariaDB (local database)",
      "MySQL for database communication",
    ],
    solutions:
      "Through this project, I got to practice building WPF applications and connecting them to a database. I combined UI design, C# logic, and database work to create a gamified study tool. It was a great way to dive deeper into how different technologies can work together, and I also got to explore how game mechanics can make learning apps more engaging and fun.",
